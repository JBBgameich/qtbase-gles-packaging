  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Update symbols files.

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * Also ship 5.conf. This makes calls to qtchooser prettier: qtchooser -qt5.

    it's totally correct for them to do so.

  [ Sune Vuorela ]
  * Prepare symbol files to track private symbols.
  * Make libqt5core5 provide a virtual package to track the non-public api/abi.
  * Create a script to mark symbols as private.

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Update lintian overrides.
  * Drop check of old hppa kernel bug, which has been fixed many years ago.
  * Update Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git headers.

  [ Timo Jyrinki ]
  * libqt5sql5-sqlite listed as first in recommends, being the lightest.

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]

    README.Debian for more details.
  * Fix typo in qtbase5-private-dev's Breaks+Replaces.

    it contains arch-qualified paths in it.
