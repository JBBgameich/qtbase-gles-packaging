    (e.g. s390x and ppc64); patch sha3_64bit_BE.diff.
  * Update/simplify lintian overrides.

    seem present on linux/ia64 kernels; patch linux_no_perf.diff.

qtbase-opensource-src (5.1.0+dfsg-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add libxkbcommon-dev as build dependency, thus avoiding using the bundled
    lib.
  * Minor improvement of mark_private_symbols.sh.
  * Add Dont_check_for_the_existence_of_priv_inc_dirs.patch that avoids making
    our users install private headers in order to compile with CMake
    (Closes: #718348).
  * Armel also builds libqkms.so, added to the proper install file.
  * Update symbols files.

qtbase-opensource-src (5.1.0+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Do not build depend on libopenvg1-mesa-dev on hurd, it's not available
    there.
  * Fix watch file with new url.
  * Make libqt5core5 provide qtbase-abi-5-1-0.
  * Update symbols files with latest 5.0.2 build logs.
  * Remove patches applied upstream:
    - undef_B0.diff
    - Rename-qAbs-Function-for-timeval.patch
    - build_examples.patch, adding the new -compile-examples switch.
  * Refresh patches: deppath_gnu.diff.
  * Bump Build-Depends-Indep qttools5-dev-tools dependency to << 5.1.0~.
  * Do not remove the include dir on cleaning the sources. Prior to Qt 5.1 perl
    would be run and re-create the includes. In 5.1, perl only runs if .git is
    found and the build is done out-of-source. Thanks Pino and Thiago for the
    hints.
  * Fix typo in -no-direcfb switch in configure.
  * Update install files.
  * Update symbols files with current build. The missing symbols seemed to be
    internal/private stuff and optional ones, so everything should be OK.
  * Mark private symbols in symbols files.
  * Add a lintian override for libqt5core5. Symbols should declare a dependency
    on qtbase-abi-5-1-0.
  * Change symbols files and lintian overrides to provide qtbase-abi-5-1-0.
  * Minimal improve of README.source with private symbols handling.
  * Remove doc packages. The build system has changed and I can't build them
    anymore.
    - Remove independent build deps.
    - Remove the doc packages from debian/control.
    - Remove their asociated install files.
    - Remove the indep targets in debian/rules.

qtbase-opensource-src (5.0.2+dfsg1-7) experimental; urgency=low

  * Mark libgbm-dev as linux-any. Other OSs do not have it.
  * Add the qkms plugin to the armhf list of files to install.
  * Update symbols files.
  * From the armhf build log: "The -arch and -host-arch options are obsolete".
    Remove the relevant armv6 option from debian/rules.
  * Add a lintian override for libqt5xml5, which rightfully declares a
    dependency on qtbase-abi-5-0-2.

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * Make packages that ship a binary managed by qtchooser depend on it.

    - Add the necessary indep build dependencies:
      * qttools5-dev-tools to use qhelpgenerator.
      * libqt5sql5-sqlite to generate qch doc.
    - Build and create a packages for qch and HTML doc formats.
    - Document how to bootstrap the packages in order to be able to build the
      documentation.

    - ALSA.
    - PulseAudio.
    - OpenVG.

  * Apply Rename-qAbs-Function-for-timeval.patch taken from upstream to solve
    FTBFS with GCC 4.8.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.4. No changes needed.
  * Make qtbase5-dbg M-A same.

qtbase-opensource-src (5.0.2+dfsg1-5) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Update symbols files.

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * Also ship 5.conf. This makes calls to qtchooser prettier: qtchooser -qt5.
  * Add lintian overrides for packages that depend on the private API/ABI,
    it's totally correct for them to do so.

  [ Sune Vuorela ]
  * Prepare symbol files to track private symbols.
  * Make libqt5core5 provide a virtual package to track the non-public api/abi.
  * Create a script to mark symbols as private.
  * Mark private symbols as private.

    README.Debian for more details.
  * Fix typo in qtbase5-private-dev's Breaks+Replaces.
  * Changed qt5-default to arch: all. Should have been like this from start, as
    it contains arch-qualified paths in it.
  * Update symbols files.
